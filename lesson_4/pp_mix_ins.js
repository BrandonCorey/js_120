// 2. You may have noticed that the string printed when we call goFast
// includes the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is that done?

// It works because goFast is called within a class,
// meaning it's prototype is set to ClassName.prototype
// and its constructor is automatically set to ClassName
// and all constructors have a name property that prints the name as a string
// so....ClassName.prototype.constructor.name is the name of the class
